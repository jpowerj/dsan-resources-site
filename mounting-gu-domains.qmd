You can use a Mac App called Mountain Duck to **mount** your GU Domains space as a disk on your local computer, so that you can upload/download/view/modify files on your GU Domains space the same way you work with files on your local computer.

On my Mac, for example, I have my GU Domains server space mounted so that my Finder sidebar looks as follows:

So that when I open this Georgetown Domains "drive", I see the following:
