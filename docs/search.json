In that case, the difficult part is not knowing the above syntax but knowing how to get the image onto your drive in the first place.\nWhen I want to include screenshots, for example, I tend to use the Mac shortcut cmd+shift+F4, which lets me take a screenshot of some portion of the screen, and then I open the saved screenshot and choose “Add to Photos”. Finally, I open up the Photos app and export the image to the images subdirectory mentioned above.\nWhen I want to include photos taken from my phone, there are a lot of different approaches based on different phone types and operating systems, but in general in my case I tend to export the photo to Google Photos or Dropbox, and then download the photo from photos.google.com or dropbox.com and include it in my .qmd file that way."
