## If You Already Have The Image File Saved Locally

If you already have an image file ready to be included in your `.qmd` file, you can include it in a `.qmd` file using the following syntax:

```
![Image caption](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

So, for example, if the image has the filename `my_image.png`, and it is saved in the **same folder** as the `.qmd` file you are trying to include it in, then the syntax would look like:

```
![Image caption](my_image.png)
```

### Using an `images` Subdirectory

If you are trying to create a `.qmd` document which uses a lot of images, it is good practice to create an `images` subdirectory in the folder where your `.qmd` file exists, so that the main directory does not get cluttered by all of the image files.

So, if we moved our `my_image.png` file into the `images` subdirectory, our syntax for including the image would now look like:

```
![Image caption](images/my_image.png)
```

## If You're Unsure How To Save The Image File Locally

Sometimes, for example, students want to take a photo or scan of a written document, or a screenshot, and include that in a `.qmd` file. In that case, the difficult part is not knowing the above syntax but knowing how to get the image onto your drive in the first place.

When I want to include **screenshots**, for example, I tend to use the Mac shortcut {{< kbd cmd+shift+F4 >}}, which lets me take a screenshot of some portion of the screen, and then I open the saved screenshot and choose "Add to Photos". Finally, I open up the Photos app and **export** the image to the `images` subdirectory mentioned above.

When I want to include **photos taken from my phone**, there are a lot of different approaches based on different phone types and operating systems, but in general in my case I tend to export the photo to **Google Photos** or **Dropbox**, and then download the photo from `photos.google.com` or `dropbox.com` and include it in my `.qmd` file that way.
